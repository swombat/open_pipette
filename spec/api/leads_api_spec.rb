  # unit tests for add_lead
  # Add a lead
  # Creates a lead. A lead always has to be linked to a person or an organization or both. All leads created through the Pipedrive API will have a lead source and origin set to &#x60;API&#x60;. Here&#39;s the tutorial for &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/adding-a-lead\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel&#x3D;\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot;&gt;adding a lead&lt;/a&gt;. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields&#39; values will be included in the response in the same format as with the &#x60;Deals&#x60; endpoints. If a custom field&#39;s value hasn&#39;t been set for the lead, it won&#39;t appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields&#39; structure from deals.

  # Search leads
  # Searches all leads by title, notes and/or custom fields. This endpoint is a wrapper of &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/ItemSearch#searchItem\&quot;&gt;/v1/itemSearch&lt;/a&gt; with a narrower OAuth scope. Found leads can be filtered by the person ID and the organization ID.
  # @param term The search term to look for. Minimum 2 characters (or 1 if using &#x60;exact_match&#x60;). Please note that the search term has to be URL encoded.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :fields A comma-separated string array. The fields to perform the search from. Defaults to all of them.
  # @option opts [Boolean] :exact_match When enabled, only full exact matches against the given term are returned. It is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; case sensitive.
  # @option opts [Integer] :person_id Will filter leads by the provided person ID. The upper limit of found leads associated with the person is 2000.
  # @option opts [Integer] :organization_id Will filter leads by the provided organization ID. The upper limit of found leads associated with the organization is 2000.
  # @option opts [String] :include_fields Supports including optional fields in the results which are not provided by default
  # @option opts [Integer] :start Pagination start. Note that the pagination is based on main results and does not include related items when using &#x60;search_for_related_items&#x60; parameter.
