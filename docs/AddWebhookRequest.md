# OpenPipette::AddWebhookRequest

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **subscription_url** | **String** | A full, valid, publicly accessible URL which determines where to send the notifications. Please note that you cannot use Pipedrive API endpoints as the &#x60;subscription_url&#x60; and the chosen URL must not redirect to another link. |  |
| **event_action** | **String** | The type of action to receive notifications about. Wildcard will match all supported actions. |  |
| **event_object** | **String** | The type of object to receive notifications about. Wildcard will match all supported objects. |  |
| **user_id** | **Integer** | The ID of the user that this webhook will be authorized with. You have the option to use a different user&#39;s &#x60;user_id&#x60;. If it is not set, the current user&#39;s &#x60;user_id&#x60; will be used. As each webhook event is checked against a user&#39;s permissions, the webhook will only be sent if the user has access to the specified object(s).
